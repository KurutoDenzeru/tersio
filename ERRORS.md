## 2026-09-23 — Malformed oldString/newString boundary in edit calls
**What happened:** Two `edit` calls produced broken intermediates: one left a stray `async function stepSelfPlugin(...);` declaration line, another dropped the `const SOURCES ... = [` opener while its array body remained. Both were caught by reading the edited region right after and repaired before building.
**Root cause:** Drafting replacement text that overlapped neighboring declarations instead of keeping the boundary to the exact lines being changed.
**Prevention rule:** Keep every edit boundary to the smallest requested change; read the edited region immediately after each structural edit and repair before moving on.
